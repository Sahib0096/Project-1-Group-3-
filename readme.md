## SUSTAINABLE INCOME GROWTH RATE

Through our analysis of Household Economic Data of Canadaian households over the past 2 Decades, We made an attempt to define and estimate **Sustainable Income Growth Rate** , an annual rate at which a typical household should expect its income to grow given an anticipated rate of Inflation and historical trends of change in disposable income and household consumption expenditure. 


Looking at Year-on-Year Change, while the disposable income has seen a near stable increase around 5% annually, only 6 Years in last 2 decades was there an increase in Household Net Savings and rest showing a decrease or insignificant increase. 2019 & 2020 being outliers attributable to COVID Situation. 

What this meant was the net savings which were at CAD 29749.0 million in 2001 came down to CAD 7733.00 million in 2018 and this negative trend seems to have returned more aggressively, owing to high levels of inflation, post COVID with decrerase in savings by around 20% in 2021 and 42% in 2022. All the while when household income has seen a stable growth.

This led to our inference that the income growth though stable is not sustainable, depleting the household savings.
